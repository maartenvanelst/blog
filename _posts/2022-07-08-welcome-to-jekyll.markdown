Hi! Welcome to my blog :)

Whenever I feel like putting something online, you'll probably be able to find it here. Some of it might be in Dutch, some in English, depending on the topic and what I feel like when writing. Take a look around, or even better: share your honest, unsalted opinion with me. Below is a list of all entries in chronological order, but you should be able to navigate by category soon&trade;!

Stuff I do is a place on the web to dump thoughts about what I've done or experienced. A place for sciencey, musicy, or heavy stuff. It's for me, but also public for a reason: you're very welcome to share your thoughts about "the stuff" with me.
